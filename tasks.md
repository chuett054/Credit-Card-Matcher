# Credit Card Recommender Tasks

## Engineer
- [X] Initialize repo; set up React (client/) and Express (server/) boilerplate  
- [ ] Build “Spend Profile” form (React) & POST `/api/spend-profile` (Express)  
- [ ] Hook scoring logic to backend; return top card  
- [ ] Create result page: card name + logo, net benefit calc  
- [ ] Demo flow and refine UX/UI

## Finance
- [ ] Gather 3–5 card profiles (e.g. Venture, Quicksilver, Savor)  
- [ ] Put key stats (rewards rates, APR, fees) into shared JSON or Google Doc  
- [ ] Draft scoring weights (e.g. 3× travel, 2× dining; penalty APR >20%)  
- [ ] Test with sample spend mixes; adjust weights  
- [ ] Draft one-slide Business Case (why this UX wins eyeballs & lowers churn)
